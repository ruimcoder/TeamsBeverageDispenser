# TeamsBeverageDispenser
A MS Teams connected IoT device that dispenses beverages at each participant's location

## Concept
With the remote work and distributed teams being more common than not, this device will allow, the participants in a call, to be automatically served of their prefered beverage.
It will need to be connected to teh Teams call, from which, the dispensing action can be started.

## General requirements

### GR1: The device needs to support different types of beverages

### GR2: The serving size can only be adjusted by the individual participant (it will depend on the associated beverage) 

### GR3: Each participant needs to provide a beverage recipient filled with they beverage of choice (intake) and a serving vesel (output)

### GR4: The device needs to pull the liquid from the beverage intake recipient. Gravity or pump can be used.

### GR5: The device needs to detect if an output vesel is available before serving a beverage

### GR5: Servings to participants should be queued and a holding period should be present to avoid overserving
